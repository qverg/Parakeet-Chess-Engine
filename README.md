# Parakeet Chess Engine

### Requirements:
 - Windows probably, not tested on other OSs but might work
 - I'm using g++ to compile (C++ 14 or higher).

For the gui (not necessary for just running the engine):
 - Definitely windows
 - Python 3 (I'm using 3.10)
    - pygame
    - pexpect

### Running just the engine
Compile using ``.\compile.bat`` inside parakeet/src and run using ``.\parakeet.exe``.

### Running the GUI
Compile using ``.\compile.bat`` inside parakeet/parakeet-gui and run using ``.\run.bat``.



lmk if you know how to get gitignore to ignore "Open VS Code here.bat"
